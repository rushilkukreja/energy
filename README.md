We are predicting energy demand for major cities in the United States using weather variables (temperature, wind speed, pressure, relative humidity, dew point) and socioeconomic factors. 

We use a variety of models such as an LSTM, GRU, and Prophet. 

Hourly energy demand data was obtained from the US Energy Information Association (EIA) from 2016 or 2018 to 2024. Hourly weather records was obtained using the Meteostat API.
