**Predicting Energy Demand for Major U.S. Cities**
-
This project leverages advanced machine learning models to predict hourly energy demand for major cities in the United States. By integrating weather variables (temperature, wind speed, pressure, relative humidity, dew point) with socioeconomic factors, we aim to provide accurate, data-driven insights into energy consumption trends.

Models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Prophet
